xmas-tree
===============

I found animated Christmas tree on reddit:

Was curious to make it in js. Current results are here: [Merry Christmas!](https://m0dulo.github.io/xmas-tree/) Wish you all great successes and joy, doing what you love!

How it's built?
---------------
The tree is built of two spirals. These [code](https://github.com/m0dulo/xmas-tree/blob/master/index.js) render one line on spiral. It includes 3d projection and background shadow. _Almost_ the same as this [wiki image](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ComplexSinInATimeAxe.gif):

It's almost perfect now

So, what's left? Just small changes which could make this tree perfect:

* Shadows are not accurate
* I think code is more complex than it should be (subjectively).
